"""WDED — Wheat Disease Early Detection inference pipeline.

Fuses UAV multispectral reflectance dynamics with lagged-weather epidemiology
and soil covariates to detect wheat infection windows (stem rust, stripe rust,
leaf rust, Septoria, Fusarium) before visible symptoms, and converts them into
calibrated, actionable field risk tiers.
